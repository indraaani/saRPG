Hi!

Inspired by #RPGSEA and #rpgLATAM, the #saRPG hashtag aims to make tabletop RPGs created by South Asian creators more discoverble and accessible to TTRPG players.

These assets were created by Indrani (@NonagonDice), with input from various TTRPG creators in the Desis & Dragons Discord community server. These logos, symbols, and files are available for any South Asian TTRPG game designers to use on their tabletop RPGs, along with the #saRPG hashtag.

Special thanks to Thomas, Tree, Ari, Apri, Shubham, Siva, and Nicole. 

Thank you, and enjoy!
